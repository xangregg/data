* Added derived columns that attempt to create shortened event names for graph point labeling.
* Examples:
* "Hurricane Matthew October 2016" -> "Matthew 2016"
* "Western Drought 2015" -> "Drought 2015"
* "Colorado Flooding September 10-16 2013" -> "Flooding 2013"

**Cape Town rainfall averages**

   So the values are only approximate.

* A few graphs tweeted at https://twitter.com/xangregg/status/1141133285088735233.

**internet_speeds_summer_2018.csv**

**journal.pone.0216362.s003.csv**
* Data from [Battle for the thermostat: Gender and the effect of temperature on cognitive performance](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216362)
* Converted form Stata DTA from to CSV
* Added a few derived fields
  * Added rounded version of temp field, so "19.1000003814697" is "19.1". I'm guessing the Stata file was compressed to use single precision floating point numbers.
  * Computed wordscore for the word problem, since the participants were rewarded by total score rather than number complete.
  * Added Gender=F|M from Male=0|1
  * Added "Temp Category" to combine indicator variables: cool, normal, warm, hot

**MosquitoTrendsData.csv**
* Google Trends mosquito search data used for [state grid blog post](http://blogs.sas.com/content/jmp/2016/05/24/remaking-mosquito-trends-chart/)

**shirt_sponsorship.csv**
* Inferred data on Premier league shirt sponsorship over time from [this FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/61f3c8fc-9c86-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d). Use for experimenting with alternates to streams.

**travel_motivation_recoded_stacked.csv**
* Recoded subset of [survey responses from /r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/99foe4/1000000_rtravel_subscriber_survey_results/).
* Includes a few demographic fields and responses to the question "What motivates you to travel?"
* This was a free-form text field. I recoded the responses into common terms and expanded multiple responses into multiple rows (with same respondent id).
* For instance, "new cultures" could have been originally "different cultures", "see new cultures", "other lifestyles", ...
* Surely, some bias or error was introduced during the recoding process.
* I made a slopegraph of the [responses by gender](https://twitter.com/xangregg/status/1052718677299273728).

**tukey_EDA_7.8_coal.csv**
* Coal production data from John Tukey's 1977 book Exploratory Data Analysis, for time series smoothing

**vaccine_safety_expressing, vaccine_safety_tcell_secretions**
* Data shown in Figure 2 of Covid-19 vaccine safety experiment paper: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext
* scraped from PDF after converting to SVG, so should be high resolution and complete, but...
* For the secretions scatter plots, each combination should have 36 dots, but the Day 0 groups are missing a few. Most values for those groups are clustered at the bottom of the scale so possibly they are clipped or omitted for space. Or maybe I made a mistake.
* The pies show 7 of the 8 possible combinations of expressions. Not sure if the all negative category is omitted because it's empty or because it's uninteresting.
* Proportions multiplied by 36 do not generally match integers. Seems like they should.
